  name: string                  // max 50 characters
  age: number                   // 13-100
  height: number                // 100-250 cm
  weight: number                // 30-300 kg
  sex?: 'male' | 'female'       // For gender-specific standards & BMR (Phase 4)

**Female Strength Multipliers (Implemented):**

| Exercise | BEG (F) | NOV (F) | INT (F) | ADV (F) |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Bench Press | 0.35 | 0.50 | 0.65 | 0.85 |
| Squat | 0.53 | 0.78 | 1.03 | 1.32 |
| Deadlift | 0.66 | 0.90 | 1.20 | 1.53 |
| Shoulder Press | 0.29 | 0.41 | 0.53 | 0.70 |

> **Note:** Female multipliers are approximately 60-70% of male multipliers, based on physiological differences and strength standards from StrengthLevel.com

#### 4.4 Calorie Calculations (Detailed)

**Step 1: Calculate BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**

Using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (most accurate):

```
Male:   BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
Female: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161
```

**Step 2: Calculate Activity Factor**

| Activity Level | Description | Multiplier |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Sedentary | Little to no exercise, desk job | 1.2 |
| Light | Light exercise 1-3 days/week | 1.375 |
| Moderate | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week | 1.55 |
| Active | Hard exercise 6-7 days/week | 1.725 |
| Very Active | Very hard exercise, physical job | 1.9 |

**Step 3: Daily Steps Adjustment**

Additional calories burned from walking:
```
Steps Calories = (steps × 0.04)  // Approx 40 calories per 1000 steps
```

**Step 4: Calculate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**

```
TDEE = (BMR × Activity Multiplier) + Steps Calories
```

**Step 5: Goal-Based Recommendations**

| Goal | Calorie Adjustment |
|------|-------------------|
| Lose Weight | TDEE - 500 (moderate deficit) |
| Maintain | TDEE |
| Gain Weight | TDEE + 300 (lean bulk) |

**Step 6: Body Composition Analysis**

```typescript
// BMI Categories
const BMI = weight / (height/100)²

Underweight: BMI < 18.5  → Recommend: Gain weight, calorie surplus
Normal:      BMI 18.5-24.9 → Recommend: Based on goal
Overweight:  BMI 25-29.9 → Suggest: Moderate deficit possible
Obese:       BMI ≥ 30    → Suggest: Calorie deficit recommended
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Profile: Male, 28 years, 178cm, 82kg, Moderate activity, 8000 steps/day

BMR = (10 × 82) + (6.25 × 178) - (5 × 28) + 5
    = 820 + 1112.5 - 140 + 5
    = 1797.5 kcal

TDEE = (1797.5 × 1.55) + (8000 × 0.04)
     = 2786 + 320
     = 3106 kcal/day (maintenance)

If goal = Lose Weight:
    Target = 3106 - 500 = 2606 kcal/day
```

#### 4.5 Nutrition Display UI
- [x] Show maintenance calories on profile page
- [x] Display recommended intake based on goal
- [x] Show BMI category with health indicator
- [x] Provide simple nutrition guidance

**UI Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📊 Nutrition Summary                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Maintenance: 3,106 kcal/day            │
│  Your Goal: Lose Weight                  │
│  Target: 2,606 kcal/day                  │
│                                          │
│  BMI: 25.9 (Slightly overweight)        │
│  💡 A 500 calorie deficit = ~0.5kg/week │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
